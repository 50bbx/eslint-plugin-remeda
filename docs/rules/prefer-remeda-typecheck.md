# remeda/prefer-remeda-typecheck

ðŸ’¼ This rule is enabled in the âœ… `recommended` config.

<!-- end auto-generated rule header -->

Getting the specific type of a variable or expression can be done with `typeof` or `instanceof`. However, it's often more expressive to use the Remeda equivalent function

## Rule Details

This rule takes no arguments.

The following patterns are considered warnings:

```js
if (typeof a === "number") {
  // ...
}

var isNotString = typeof b !== "string";

var isArray = a instanceof Array;
```

The following patterns are not considered warnings:

```js
var areSameType = typeof a === typeof b;

var isCar = truck instanceof Car;
```

## When Not To Use It

If you do not want to enforce using Remeda methods for type checks, you should not use this rule.
